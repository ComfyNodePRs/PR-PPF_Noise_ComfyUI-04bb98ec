# PPF_Noise_ComfyUI
 Perlin Power Fractal Noisey Latents

Test environment description: 
I will be working with the 2.1 model (rmada merge) and lock seed number 1 to generate 768*768-sized images.
I will be using the advanced K-sampler built into comfyui, with both K-samplers set to the same values. No negative prompts will be used for the samplers. 
I believe I have created a fair platform to compare the two lanterns. Additionally, to account for the impact of computer hardware temperature on image quality, each test will have a five-minute interval.I have also provided the download for the workflow used in this test. 
The test content will be limited based on prompts. All prompts will be limited to comparing the following aspects against a black background: 
rainbow (color comparison), plastic bag (transparency, i.e., how white is handled, and details such as folds, i.e., black contrast), metal ball (comparison based on texture, although it's difficult to quantify, I just like metal balls), and glass cup
